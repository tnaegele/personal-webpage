      <description>This portfolio provides a non-exhaustive list of selected recent project highlights. In places specific details may remain undisclosed until later publication in full in either publication or patent form. I am always happy to discuss with interested parties.&#xA;Redox Flow Iontophoresis for Brain Cancer Therapy Illustration of the redox flow iontophoresis concept, Adv. Mater. Technol. 9, 2024&#xA;Drug delivery to the brain and spinal cord is limited by the blood-brain barrier, which is a major reason for the poor prognosis of brain tumours.</description>

      <description>I am an early career researcher specialising in innovative approaches to neural interfaces and brain cancer treatment, working at the interface of physics, engineering and neuroscience. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge. My academic journey began in physics, which I later combined with expertise in neurotechnology and bioelectronics engineering.&#xA;I relish the opportunity to work at the highly interdisciplinary interface of neurotechnology, engineering, physics, chemistry, and neurosurgery.</description>
